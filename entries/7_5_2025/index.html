        <h1>I went to my grandmothers funeral today</h1>
        <p>This is only the 2nd one I have ever been to and the last was in like 2018.
            We actually had a pretty good family gathering out of it though.
            There was this lady singing (the speaker was up WAYY too loud mind you) that reminded me of Raven-SymonÃ© (from That's So Raven if you're old like me),
            and I told my sister and she was thinking the same thing ðŸ˜­... so that was funny.
            And then my uncle went up there a few times but it wasn't his turn yet so we kept kinda laughing at that,
            But when it finally was his turn... he was talking like forever and me and other people were starting to fall asleep actually lol. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="cat sleeping zzz" width="40" src="../../cute-emojis/emojis/1319380195236384879.gif">
            He was just yapping for like 15 mins dude like I could not be bothered to stay awake for any of that.
            After the thing ended at the church, we went to the cemetery thing to bury her. But on the way there was sort of fun
            because we were in the car with the purple flags on it and driving in a line
            and i've never seen everybody stop just for US so that was kinda cool heh.
            But my sister she had to step out of line to get some gas because the thing was like 20 mins away
            and she was had almost none left.
            Sooo then after gas we went to go find the place and... we got lost and confused a lot.
            We went to this place and there was nobody there so my sister and my niece (who's older than me)
            were just kinda laughing because we had no idea what we were doing and my sister was saying like
            <q>Why do <em>I</em> have to be the adult in this situation?</q> because we were
            all just relying on her to do stuff and she had no clue what was going on lmao.
            So then we finally found where we were supposed to go and ofc everyone is already there so
            we kinda just had to awkwardly walk up there while they were already burying her.
            And after that, everyone was just there for about 10 mins talking and hanging out.
            Then everyone went to the place were we were supposed to have food at.
            But OF COURSE... nobody has any idea what we are doing or where we are going.
            So we got confused AGAIN and everyone went to the wrong place (some random hotel)
            and it was kinda a family bonding moment bc we were all lost.
            But then we finally made it and got there (thankfully!).
            I entered and got a plate but then i was like wait nobody else is eating, maybe im not supposed to get any food?
            So i just sat down with my plate.
            AND I WAS RIGHT! We were not supposed to eat yet. That would have been VERY awkward for me
            if i was the only one in the whole room with food.
            But yeah then they called everyone up to go eat based on how close they were to my grandmother.
            I was one of the first ones to get to eat since I am "immediate family member", was kinda confused
            about that but okay!!!
            We had GREAT food... I had lobster macaroni for the first and it was great!!
            Also ate like 5 bread sticks ðŸ˜‹ðŸ¤¤.
            Then we sat there and talked for about ~45 minutes and eventually I told my sister
            that I was super sleepy and to take me home, and she was sleepy too so we eventually left.
            But when I got home the door was locked ðŸ¥² so I had to wait out there for about 10 mins
            for my mom to finally come home.
        </p>
