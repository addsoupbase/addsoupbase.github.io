<h1>I didn't have enough time to write it, but here's what happened yesterday:</h1>
        <p >So my family picked me up and we visited our grandmother in the hospital who is ~80 and we were all just there for her.
        They also gave me like $700 😭.
            Also I learned that my grandmother has <em>10 children</em>, and she had her first one when she was <em>14</em>... that was a little weird when they told me that but OKAY!
        After that, we went to a mexican restaurant and I got a burrito thing (honestly, it didn't taste very good but it's whatever)!
            Then, we went to my aunts house and I played with 3 dogs there!!!
            There were 2 big ones and 1 little tiny one 🥺 THEY WERE ADORABLE.
            But I got a lot of dog hair on my clothes... and my mom is allergic, so i had to wipe it off when i got home.
            Today was REALLY GREAT, I had a lot of fun. i hadn't seen some of my family in a few years so that was nice :&rpar;
        </p>
        <p>...</p>
        <h2>Today:</h2>
        <h3>Before:</h3>
        <div id="spoiler" class="spoiler">
        <p>I've just been crying alone in my room most of today because I feel lonely, no matter how much I surround myself with people.
            No matter how many people i talk to,
            Or how many friends I have,
            Or even how many people claim to love me,
            I still feel like I'm alone.
            I might be dead on my birthday, it really isn't looking much like a "happy" birthday at this point.
        </p>
        <p>Idk what i want anymore. i thought it was friends, or a relationship, but i'm still not happy and i don't know what will fix that anymore.
            Again i hate being around people, but i also hate being alone.
            I just want to be happy...
            I'm so envious of people who are happy and have friendships and relationships... and it makes me feel like a loser.
            My life is a mess, and it's only going to get worse.
            Anxiety is the #1 reason everything is so horrible.
            There is no cure once again as much as i wish there was!!
            Also it would be kind of cool to have a tombstone like:
        </p>
        <strong>🪦 June 17, 2007 - June 17, 2025 🪦</strong>
        <p>My grandmother will likely outlive me lol</p>
        <h2>Anyway:</h2>
        <p>I've never really had close friends as a kid. I've never been to someones house. I've never met with anyone outside of school.
            I think i was the only one like this in my class.
            I kind of hope this ends up on the news after i die so people can at least know my story.
            And how i really felt in those moments.
        </p>
        </div>
        <h3>After:</h3>
        <p id="yay">GUYS IGNORE EVERYTHING I JUST WROTE EARLIER! SUDDENLY IM SO HAPPY BASICALLY SOMETHING HAPPENED WITH SOMEONE AND IT MADE ME SO HAPPY SO I WILL NOT GIVE UP FOR YOU THEY KNOW WHO THEY ARE I LOVE YOU
        </p>
