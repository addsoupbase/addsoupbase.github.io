<h1>I didn't have enough time to write it, but here's what happened yesterday:</h1>
        <p >So my family picked me up and we visited our grandmother in the hospital who is ~80 and we were all just there for her.
        They also gave me like $700 😭.
            Also I learned that my grandmother has <em>10 children</em>, and she had her first one when she was <em>14</em>... that was a little weird when they told me that but OKAY!
        After that, we went to a mexican restaurant and I got a burrito thing (honestly, it didn't taste very good but it's whatever)!
            Then, we went to my aunts house and I played with 3 dogs there!!!
            There were 2 big ones and 1 little tiny one 🥺 THEY WERE ADORABLE.
            But I got a lot of dog hair on my clothes... and my mom is allergic, so i had to wipe it off when i got home.
            Today was REALLY GREAT, I had a lot of fun. i hadn't seen some of my family in a few years so that was nice :)
        </p>
