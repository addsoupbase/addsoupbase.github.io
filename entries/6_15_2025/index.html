            <h1>I didn't have enough time to write it, but here's what happened yesterday:</h1>
            <p>So my family picked me up and we visited our grandmother in the hospital who is ~80 and we were all just
                there for her.
                They also gave me like $700 😭.
                Also I learned that my grandmother has <em>10 children</em>, and she had her first one when she was
                <em>14</em>... that was a little weird when they told me that but OKAY!
                After that, we went to a mexican restaurant and I got a burrito thing (honestly, it didn't taste very
                good but it's whatever)!
                Then, we went to my aunts house and I played with 3 dogs there!!!
                There were 2 big ones and 1 little tiny one 🥺 THEY WERE ADORABLE.
                But I got a lot of dog hair on my clothes... and my mom is allergic, so i had to wipe it off when i got
                home.
                Today was REALLY GREAT, I had a lot of fun. i hadn't seen some of my family in a few years so that was
                nice :)
            </p>
            <p>...</p>
            <h2>Today:</h2>
            <h3>Before:</h3>
            <div id="spoiler" class="spoiler">
                <p>I've just been crying alone in my room most of today because I feel lonely, no matter how much I
                    surround myself with people.
                    No matter how many people i talk to,
                    Or how many friends I have,
                    Or even how many people claim to love me,
                    I still feel like I'm alone.
                    I might be dead on my birthday, it really isn't looking much like a "happy" birthday at this point.
                </p>
                <p>Idk what i want anymore. i thought it was friends, or a relationship, but i'm still not happy and i
                    don't know what will fix that anymore.
                    Again i hate being around people, but i also hate being alone.
                    I just want to be happy...
                    I'm so envious of people who are happy and have friendships and relationships... and it makes me
                    feel like a loser.
                    My life is a mess, and it's only going to get worse.
                    Anxiety is the #1 reason everything is so horrible.
                    There is no cure once again as much as i wish there was!!
                    Also it would be kind of cool to have a tombstone like:
                </p>
                <strong>🪦 June 17, 2007 - June 17, 2025 🪦</strong>
                <p>My grandmother will likely outlive me lol</p>
                <h2>Anyway:</h2>
                <p>I've never really had close friends as a kid. I've never been to someones house. I've never met with
                    anyone outside of school.
                    I think i was the only one like this in my class.
                    I kind of hope this ends up on the news after i die so people can at least know my story.
                    And how i really felt in those moments.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>After:</h3>
            <p id="yay">GUYS IGNORE EVERYTHING I JUST WROTE EARLIER! SUDDENLY IM SO HAPPY BASICALLY SOMETHING HAPPENED
                WITH SOMEONE AND IT MADE ME SO HAPPY SO I WILL NOT GIVE UP FOR YOU THEY KNOW WHO THEY ARE I LOVE YOU
            </p>
