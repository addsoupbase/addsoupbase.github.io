                <h1>OKOK SO something really amazing happened</h1>
                <p>So basically, there was someone i hated a lot in this server... like i hated them a LOTTT.
                    They constantly would act super annoying and just generally be a POS, but the problem
                    was that most other people in the server didn't mind it.
                    We actually used to be friends a little and i used to like talking with them.
                    But over time i started to notice their true colours, and what kind of person they actually are.
                </p>
                <p>They were like obsessed with the owner and would like write weird poems and stuff.
                    As well as bragging about being addicted to drugs, and the constant attention seeking.
                    Also being <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_douchebag"
                        target="_blank">Hypocritical</a>.
                    And they actually got banned for like a week i think before coming back.
                    And i felt kinda bad and thought i could help them with their problems and see them become better.
                    I thought things would turn out normal eventually... everyone deserves a 2nd chance right??
                </p>
                <strong style="font-size:2em">Wrong. So so wrong.</strong>
                <h2>Fast forward to today right</h2>
                <p>They did something <em>REALLY</em> messed up that made <em>EVERYONE</em> in the server turn
                    against them. They leaked a 12-year-old's, let's just say inappropriate pictures, which is
                    <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography" target="_blank">LITERALLY ILLEGAL
                            (wikipedia article)</a></em> by the way!
                </p>
                <p>THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WRONG WITH THAT LIKE, WHAT KIND OF PERSON ARE YOU</p>
                <h2>Usually i wouldn't condone harassment, but in this case it's to report an ACTUAL CRIME.</h2>
                <p>So here is that persons username:</p>

                    They probably already quit discord anyway so yeah

                <h2>IT WAS SO FUNNY WATCHING EVERYONE HATE THEM</h2>
                <p>Like it just brought me this sort of validation that i'm not in the wrong
