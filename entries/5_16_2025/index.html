            <h1>I'm so tired</h1>
            <p>Talking to people about it doesn't help at all, i think i'm just meant to live life alone</p>
            <p>I cannot take this anymore, i don't see myself living past 18 really</p>
            <p>That's just the reality of it. Sorry to anyone who had believed in me. But it turns out i cannot be
                helped...
                i tried to make a human connection with people
                but it just feels so awkward and forced. Everybody else seems to just be able to do it easily with no
                thought. but it's not
                that simple for me.
                Every conversation goes like this:<br><br>
                → Hi<br>
                ← HIIIII<br>
                → Hru<br>
                ← IMGOOD HBU<br>
                → Im good<br>
                <br>
                <b>AND THEN I <em>NEVER</em> KNOW WHAT TO SAY NEXT. </b><br>
                LIKE WHY IS IT SO HARD.
                i never have anything interesting to say to anyone ever... and i'm sorry if you're one
                of the people who i ghosted. You aren't missing much... and i feel like nobody truly enjoys my presence
                anyway... i usually get ignored by most people: my family and even people who i call my (online) friend.
                i tried to make a friend irl and it didn't go well, it was really awkward and i could tell i was
                bothering
                them.
                I also just get really jealous of other people and their friends and how long they have known eachother.
                And now that im out of high school, i officially went through the whole 4 years without making a
                <em>single</em> friend.
                I know nobody is actually going to read this, it's mainly just for after i'm dead, so
                they can at least understand what my last few weeks of life were like... and how i felt in those
                moments.
                In a way it's like a *** note i guess?
                If i ever one day i disappear just know i'm not suffering anymore :')
                All of those embarrassing moments will no longer haunt me.
                My family thinks i'm improving and getting better with the therapy, meanwhile i'm just agreeing to
                everything
                they say and yeah.
                Maybe stuff would have turned out well if we moved to North Carolina but that never happened... life
                lets me
                down again.
                But WHATEVER! The raccoons in my attic will keep me company at least...
            </p>
