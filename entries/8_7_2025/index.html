            <h2>Okay, so this is how the interview went</h2>
            <p>So I got there and I just asked an employee where [name] was, for an interview.
                They were already having another interview so i had to just like stand there for a few minutes.
                But after they were done it was my turn!!
                So then this fruity guy brings me to the interview room and then it starts.
                Originally i was supposed to have someone else in there with
                me for help but she didn't show up so i had to do it alone.
                He just asked me the usual stuff like my schedule, and it went well.
                I was really nervous at first but i felt better after a bit.
                The store like really needed people so i'm most likely gonna get hired anyway.
