            <h1>Here is every shiny Pokemon i have caught, and the story behind them!!</h1>
            <h2><q>Cleetus</q> (crobat)</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="cleetus.png" class="p" alt="crobat" width="92" height="92">

            </figure>
            <small>(the date is way off for this one because i used to change the time on my DS a lot)</small>
            <p>I remember i caught it in Mt. Coronet and like i just had this feeling at the back
                of my head like "i feel like i'm gonna find a shiny" and then i found a Zubat!!.
                It's called Cleetus because like it's an inside joke between me and my sister
            </p>
            <h2>Regirock</h2>
            <figure>
                <img loading="lazy" src="regirock.png" alt="regirock" class="p gen3" width="64" height="64">
                <figcaption>Regirock in Pokemon Ruby</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>OKAY SO THIS ONES COOL FOR A FEW REASONS. First off, this is the first shiny I caught
                in Gen 3. And second, the first (and only) shiny LEGENDARY i've ever caught. AND i found it
                on the first try SO LIKE THAT WAS CRAZY!!
            </p>
            <p>I was NOT about to take any chances, so i just threw my master ball immediately lol</p>
            <h2><q>GoldBoxer</q> (Medicham)</h2>
            <figure>
                <img loading="lazy" src="medicham.png" class="p" alt="medicham" width="80" height="80">

            <time datetime="2016-08-01">Caught on August 1st 2016</time>
            <p>This one was also found in Mt. Coronet lol, and when i saw (the meditite), like my
                heart dropped omg it was so crazy 😭😭. I think the nickname was too long so i had to remove the
                space(?)
            </p>
            <h2><q>Gold Bolt</q> (Luxray)</h2>
            <figure>
                <img loading="lazy" src="luxray.png" alt="luxray" class="p" width="104" height="104">

            <time datetime="2016-05-06">Caught on May 6th 2016</time>
            <p>OMG this one brings me back. I had literally just started playing (pearl) and
                it was one of the first encounters of the game ever (Route 203). I remember i encountered the Shinx and
                i thought my DS glitched or something and then i realised heh
            </p>
            <h2><q>Gold Rock</q> (Golem)</h2>
            <figure>
                <img loading="lazy" src="golem.png" alt="golem" class="p" width="80" height="80">

            </figure>
            <time datetime="2016-08-28">Caught on August 28th 2016</time>
            <p>I met this little guy as a Geodude at Route 207, and i remember i was in the laundry
                mat store with my family, since our washer was broken or something idk
            </p>
            <p>Notice the trend of Gold * since they are all yellow!</p>
            <h1>BONUS:</h1>
            <h2><del>Seaking</del></h2>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>This was the ONLY shiny i failed!!🥲 So basically what happened was:
                I was in the safari zone (where pokemon can flee from you) and as soon as i found it
                i knew <strong>exactly</strong> what was about to happen, so i just stared at it for like 5 minutes...
                and then of course i tried
                to catch it twice and then it fleed ☹️
